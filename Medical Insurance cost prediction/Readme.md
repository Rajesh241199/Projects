#  MEDICAL INSURANCE COST PREDICTION 

**Abstract** 
Insurance is a policy that eliminates or decreases loss costs occurred by various risks. Various factors influence the cost of insurance. These considerations contribute to the insurance policy formulation. Machine learning (ML) for the insurance industry sector can make the wording of insurance policies more efficient. This study demonstrates how different models of regression can forecast insurance costs.

**Steps For Buliding a  Model**

1. Display Top 5 Rows of The Dataset

2. Check Last 5 Rows of The Dataset
3. Find Shape of Our Dataset (Number of Rows And Number of Columns)
4. Get Information About Our Dataset Like Total Number Rows, Total Number of Columns, Datatypes of Each Column And Memory Requirement
5. Check Null Values In The Dataset
6. Get Overall Statistics About The Dataset
Covert Columns From String ['sex','smoker', 'region' ] To Numerical Values
8. Store Feature Matrix In X and Response(Target) In Vector y
9. Making a visualization using the matplot library and seaborn library
10. Data Processing 
11. Train/Test split
          1. Split data into two-part: a training set and a testing set
          2. Train the model(s) on the training set
          3. Test the Model(s) on the Testing set
12. model training
    loading the linear Regression model
13. model evaluation
prediction on training data  
14. Finding R square value for training data 
15. prediction on test data 
16. Finding R square value for test data 


*Building Predictive system*
1. changing the input_data to a numpy data
2. reshape the array
3. print("The insurance cost in USD",prediction[0])
